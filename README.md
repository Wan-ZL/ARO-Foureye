# Foureye: Cyber Defensive Deception based on Hypergame Theory for Tactical Networks

Conventional security mechanisms, such as access control mechanisms and intrusion detection systems, help deal with outside and inside threats but inadequately resist attackers subverting controls or posing new attacks. Deception is a third line of defense aiming to thwart potential attackers. The key idea of deception is to manipulate an attacker’s beliefs to mislead their decision making, inducing them to act suboptimally. Although game-theoretic approaches have been extensively explored for defensive deception, how to mislead an attacker’s belief by deception has not been investigated. Specifically, conventional game theory assumes that all players play the same game whereas in real life an attacker and defender may have different views of their conflict. Hypergame Theory (HT) has been applied to solve dynamic decision making accommodating uncertainty, incomplete information, and bounded rationality. HT is well-suited to modeling attack-defense interactions and has been applied to conflicts in adversarial settings. However, hy pergame theory has not been leveraged for designing and analyzing defensive deception. We propose to apply defensive deception in tactical networks characterized by severe resource constraints, high operational tempo, high hostility, and the nature of distributed components, where an attacker and defender play a hypergame with a different view based on their learning and sub jective beliefs. Specifically, we propose to develop a suite of effective and efficient deception techniques that can control an attacker’s belief and maximally mislead its decision making in carrying out its attack. To this end, we identify three research tasks: (1) design and analyze an attack-defense hypergame using defensive deception techniques developed based on objectives, effectiveness, and risk along with an attack-defense tree to derive attack and defense strategies; (2) develop strategy selection algorithms where the attacker and defender’s beliefs and utilities are dynamically estimated under uncertainty; and (3) validate the performance of the proposed deception techniques based on cross-validation using multiple evaluation methods and realistic tactical application scenarios.
